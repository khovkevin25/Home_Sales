# Home_Sales

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we were tasked to use SparkSQL in order to determine some key metrics about home sales. Average prices based on different criteria were found by utilizing Spark to create temporary views and partition the data.

The code used to run this analysis can be found in "Home_Sales.ipynb". The challenge skeleton provided by the instructor was used as a reference for this challenge.
